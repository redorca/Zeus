                    FAST support for Zeus1 M

        --amend:  Add more of the driver code from my dev branches.
                  Create a new board directory, configs/zeus_austin.

        --amend:  Rename the configs board directory to fast_api_debug.

        --amend:  Finish rename changes with updates for Kconfig and
                  nrf52_serial.c; if CONFIG_DEBUG_FEATURES were not
                  selected then arch/arm/src/nrf52 would fail to build
                  because calls to some functions were blocked out
                  without that config var and -Werror -Wall is set.

        --amend:  Update Kconfig and add config spec variables such
                  as setting gpio pins for jtag.  Added nsh/ in
                  configs/fast_api_debug

        --amend:  Garbage associated with getting files to build that
                  call into the fast_debug driver.

        Enabling fast_jtag_read/write

        --amend:  Correct header blocking defines to reflect
                  the .git relative path appropriately
                  Pick up a couple of files that had been missed
                  in the earlier check-in.

        --amend:  Added "#inclucde "fast_api.h" to  fast_api_zeus1.c
                  to pick up jtag defines.  Need to reorg this sothat
                  the api file doesn't have to contain this info which
                  should be internal only anyway.

        Prep for adding a gpio api

        --amend: Pick up the gpio files that were forgotten.  They are
                 added here.

        --amend: Add IOC commands for Zeus1.

        --amend: Swap out Dialog SDK gpio calls for nRF52. Get to compile
                 Still need to update pin values in the calls.

        --amend:  A) Cleanup of the code
        --amend:  R) Added JTAG driver and kconfig for nrf52
        --amend:  J) Cleanup the FAST API driver folder
        --amend:  U) Run a good version of pre_commit for styling.
        --amend:  N) remove drivers/fast_api/fast_zeus.h
            :-)

       --amend:  Rebuild the nsh/defconfig file to pick up the new config
                 sym names converting code references appropriately.

       --amend:  Update defconfig files in configs/fast_api_debug to point
                 ARCH_BOARD to "fast_api_debug"

       --amend:  Fixup IOCTL switch prep for test compile

       --amend:  After realizing my copy of the api was out of date rebuilt
                 the header and ioctl command files and brutally forced them
                 to compile.

       --amend:  Cherry pick changes from Min's 2205

       --amend: Sync up with change 2171

       --amend: Add limit to how much of the flash can be read
                and returned to the caller.
