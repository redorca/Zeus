 * Description:
 *   All nrf52 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This entry point
 *   is called early in the initialization -- after all memory has been configured
 *   and mapped but before any devices have been initialized.
 *

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_initialize().  board_initialize() will be
 *   called immediately after up_intiialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.
