 * Name: nrf52_boardinitialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   All nrf52 architectures must provide the following entry point.  This entry point
 *   is called early in the initialization -- after all memory has been configured
 *   and mapped but before any devices have been initialized.
 *
 ************************************************************************************/

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_initialize
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_INITIALIZE is selected, then an additional
 *   initialization call will be performed in the boot-up sequence to a
 *   function called board_initialize().  board_initialize() will be
 *   called immediately after up_intiialize() is called and just before the
 *   initial application is started.  This additional initialization phase
 *   may be used, for example, to initialize board-specific device drivers.

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: board_crashdump
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_CRASHDUMP is selected then up_asseert will call out to
 *   board_crashdump prior to calling exit in the case of an assertion failure.
 *   Or in the case of a hardfault looping indefinitely. board_crashdump then
 *   has a chance to save the state of the machine. The provided
 *   board_crashdump should save as much information as it can about the cause
 *   of the fault and then most likely reset the system.
 *
 *   N.B. There are limited system resources that can be used by the provided
 *   board_crashdump function. The tems from the fact that most critical/fatal
 *   crashes are because of a hard fault or during interrupt processing.
 *   In these cases, up_assert is running from the context of an interrupt
 *   handlerand it is impossible to use any device driver in this context.
 *
 *   Also consider the following: Who knows what state the system is in? Is
 *   memory trashed? Is the Heap intact? Therefore all we can expect to do in
 *   board_crashdump is save the "machine state" in a place where on the next
 *   reset we can write it to more sophisticated storage in a sane operating
 *   environment.
