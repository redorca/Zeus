## Welcome to the Zglue SDK.
@tableofcontents

  What is provided is only one part of a development environment necessary to work with a zip. The goal is to give you enough information and advice that you can have a simple app running by the end of the day (defined as 14 hours after awakening).

The SDK is designed to support multiple RTOSs across the ZIP architectures and multiple communications platforms.
